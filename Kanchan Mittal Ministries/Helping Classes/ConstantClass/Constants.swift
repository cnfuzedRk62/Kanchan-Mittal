        static let aboutText = "Pastor Kanchan Mittal was born on 21 October, 1979. Even though, she was very religious and a firm believer in the presence of God, her life was full of troubles. With those problems she always had questions about the existence of God and why he does not respond to our prayers. From the very age of 5 she was aware of mantras and her search of God started in her childhood itself. She lost her mother at a very young age. Her mother died due to cancer. In the same year, her elder sister died due to attacks of evil spirit. This made her search fierier. Soon she was married but still she could not find peace. Just after a few days of her marriage, her husband was hospitalised. He suffered from migraine and typhoid was a monthly affair.\nHer search of God was persistent. One day someone told her that her father had converted his religion. This raised her religious patriotism and she fought with the Pastor who had baptized her father. The argument took hours and she was determined to trap the pastor in his words. But even with the rude manner in which she was talking to the pastor, she was unable to find any flaws. She interrogated the pastor with questions of life, trying to find reason to blaspheme. Instead, she was touched by the patience of the pastor and the way he gave her the answers of her questions not by himself but from a book that was ‘Bible’. The meeting with the pastor changed her life and she found the truth. Her persistent search of God established her relationship with God, strengthened her faith and gave her purpose of life\nBut this was just the beginning, as the pastor had already told her that life won’t be easy but nothing seemed really difficult after knowing that the spirit of God was with her now. Soon her husband, when he knew about her reading bible, started fighting with her every day. She was told to leave her house along with her 2 kids, so they ended up at Faridabad.\nShe started teaching in a slum school for living and volunteered for service at a church. Her husband used to visit the church to see what she did there, but he did not find anything wrong about what was taught at that place. Nothing had actually changed, the way she dressed, her name or the way she talked was all same. Now it came to pass, that he decided to take her home by false claims so he could convince her to leave God but soon he was struck with great illness. So much so, that he could not speak. He was broken. Then his wife Kanchan Mittal scolded him. She asked him to believe in the works of God. She prayed for him and his illness was all gone. From that day until now he has never been ill.Their business was establishes and they started living a happy life. But she was chosen to accomplish the works of God. One day, the spirit of God spoke to her and told her what she had been chosen for. Even though it was hard, she decided to dedicate her life for the service of God and she has saved thousands of souls in the guidance of Holy Spirit and she’s continuing the work of spreading the gospel since 2011.Working with the vision, Pastor Kanchan Mittal has dedicated her whole life towards fulfilment of the great mission of saving souls, propagating the message of love, peace, deliverance, prosperity and happiness, awakening the world and spreading the good news of coming of Lord Jesus Christ.\nA prophetic healer and Woman of God, Pastor Kanchan Mittal is the Founder of The Church of Peace located at The Church Road, Village Sanauli, and Zirakpur. It was established in the year 2011 and is registered as “The Flames of Fire Ministries”.

Jesus Christ was crucified for our sins.  All who believe and are baptized are free and belong to the living Jesus Christ. He seals them in his and regenerates them to a new life. After his resurrection, Jesus sent a helper who is the Holy Spirit. Holy Spirit bestows spiritual gifts on his people. The Holy Bible is the Word of God and God talks to us and guides us through The Holy Bible.\nIt is the will of God that we are seen in his likeness and in his character. He wants us to be blemish free and perfect in character. It is a task assigned by Jesus to all who have been set free through spirit that they share their testimonies and the good news of Christ with the people who need it."
